# C-Programs

This repository is for all my C programs practice and also projects.

### Notes:
**dad-lessons** folder is for C files that are from dad's lessons.
**self** folder is for my own, self-made C programs.
**tests** folder is for tests to test the GitHub workspace.

Check out the projects for a kanban board on what to do.
